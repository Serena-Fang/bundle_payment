# Bundle Payment Case Study

## Introduction
Payment reform efforts for health care are underway across the United States. Bundled payment is a exemplary new model under the current exploration. Bundled payment refers to providing a fixed payment for all services provided during a single episode of care. The payment is later distributed among all providers in the health care system. Contemporary recognition of the significance of bundle payment stems mainly from its increased efficiency, coordination and reduced health care costs. Such a payment model is in stark contrast, and often be compared with the currently dominant fee-for-service model— where patients pay separately for provided services.

In this case study, the bundled payment applies to a specific patient population and is intended to cover the costs of the patient’s care from the inpatient stay through 60 days post-operatively. I will take the role of an analyst, to examine financial implications for a new bundled payment model my hospital is adopting. To be specific, I’ll use R-programming to assess the current “fee-for-service” environment and the new bundled payment model by analysing parameters like cost, profits, number of patients, etc. Then, I’ll dig in various aspects of the new care model, examining things like quality of care, barriers, potential competitions, and so on.
By assessing all these aspects, I want to find whether my hospital should adopt such a bundled payment model or not.

## Current Financial Position
In this case study, I employed data from three dataset. The first one is “Beneficiary dataset” which provides demographic variables for unique beneficiaries such as race, ethnicity and age. The second one is “Inpatient utilisation and cost dataset” which provides information about hospital admissions among the beneficiaries, along with the corresponding dates, costs, and Medicare payments for each inpatient stay. The third one is “Physician (outpatient) utilisation and cost dataset” which provides information of physician visits among beneficiaries, along with the dates, costs, and Medicare payments for each visit.

From the dataset, we have 10 hospitals in total. Hospitals with IDs 1-5 are inside my system, and hospitals with IDs 6-10 are outside of my system. Among all hospitals, the total number of patients is 5000, the total number of inpatient stays is 17,434 and total number of physician visits is 42,571. We will evaluate episodes of care from 2012.1.7 to 2015.5.27.
 
From the table below, we can see that hospitals inside our system make a total of $93.976M revenue, $69.633M cost, and $24.343M profit. Each hospital’s revenue, cost, and profit is also shown in the table.

## Financial Effects of Bundled Payments
Our hospitals now have 8,702 visits in total. The table below demonstrates the average 60-day revenue and average 60-day cost for each hospital and the average of five during the episode of care. The average 60-day cost of care is $11,460.24 million dollars for the five hospitals.

Then, our hospital system wants to adopt a new bundled payment care model which reduces costs for this patient population by 10% in our hospitals.

The table and the figure below show the average 60-day revenues and average 60-day costs for our hospitals after 10% deduction of costs. The average 60-day cost of care is $10,491.58 million dollars. However, we can see that, compared with average cost $11,460.24 M before deduction of cost, the average 60-day cost of care is only deducted by about 8.45 % instead of 10%. That’s because the average cost also include other things like physician costs, which don’t change.

By doing this, we save 10% of the internal cost. For the five systems, we could save up to $8,429,322M in total. In other words, the 10% difference will bring additional $8,429,322M profits into our bundled payment framework. However, it will not affect hospitals outside the system.
 
As we adopt the new health care model and deduct the cost, we also want to keep patient loyalty in order to make maintain profits. In order to make full patient loyalty for our hospital system, we would like to find the 10% lost cost from hospitals outside the system. If we would be able to bring the 10% lost cost into our system, then we would be able to save this amount. The total cost outside the system is $14,762,651 M. So we would pay $1,476,265.1 M in order to ensure that people only visit our hospitals. The cost we could save in our own system is about 5.7 times more than which we would like to pay to ensure patient loyalty, so we have enough money to keep patients stay in our hospitals. Therefore, if we adopt the bundled payment model, we could ensure patients to receive the care we provided without visiting external hospitals. At the same time, we could make a lot more profits than before.

Moreover, there are also alternative ways to make patients stay. One way is to expand the system by buying hospitals from 6-10. By doing this, we have more facilities, better control how care is delivered, and thus take advantage of bundled payment more.

## Qualitative discussion of bundled payments:
  
The bundled payment model might impair or improve hospital quality, depending on the situation. Since patients pay one price for the entire episode, health care providers can save money by giving services of lower quality. In other words, if they spend more, they lose money. Moreover, since the model is used for specific services like hip replacement, it might cause physicians to focus on certain operations instead of seeing the patient as a whole individual. Some symptoms of patients’ sickness may be omitted, and thus impairing the quality of care. There are also evidences suggesting that under this model, health care systems will develop the tendency to avoid “sick” patients and prefer the “healthy” ones in order to maximise profits. In such situation, the overall hospital quality also might be impaired. However, under the bundled payment model, quality of care might be improved because of enhanced coordination, collaboration and efficiancy between health care providers. Regarding to the providers’ services, many hospitals introduced a penalty and bonus system for providers to ensure quality. Many researches suggest that these practices’s improvements on hospital quality seem to outweigh those impairments. 

If everyone pays based on the bundled payment model, there will be transparency of costs and services for patients and payers. The bundled payment for the clinical episode becomes clear “products” for a single basket of services. Thus, patients are provided with meaningful data to compare quality and prices between various hospitals before entering. This introduces competition in hospital market, incentivizing hospitals to lower costs and improve quality. Moreover, as a result of the bundled payment and competition, small providers may be squeeze out of the market since they lack certain facilities and physicians for some whole procedures. For example, academic health centres which prioritize research and teaching will be negatively affected. Big hospitals will dominate the hospital market.

Regarding to commercial insurance prices, there are two ways that the new health care model can affect. Firstly, patients and payers may prefer bundled payment as it provides them with more transparent agreements and predicativity of costs. Thus, bundled payment enjoys increased market share, facilitates competitiveness into whole insurance market, and affects bargaining price for insurers and hospitals. The prices for commercial insurance patients will decrease according to the competition. Secondly, commercial insurers may use the bundle payment the Medicare would pay in their own payment system. Since the negotiated price is Medicare payment at first, if Medicare adopts bundled payment model, it is likely that commercial insurance patients also follow the model, and thus change the contract of price, to a either higher or lower one. To be specific, if the bundled payment assumes more risks and is higher than total of individual payments, the commercial price will also go higher. If the bundled payment assumes less risks and is cheaper than total of individual payments, the commercial price will decrease.  

There are still barriers to successfully implementing such a model, though. Firstly, there is a lack of studies addressing complexities of the model, so there would be high costs in designing and implementing bundled payment. Secondly, the model may discourage small providers who lack facilities and sufficient staff resources to support the network. Thirdly, sometimes when the patient have multiple chronic conditions that interact with each other, it becomes ambiguous whether the bundle should include costs of caring for all those problems. Lastly, bundled payment makes it hard for population-based payment model like ACO to be successful. As providers find the profitable savings throughout the procedure, it becomes difficult for ACO to determine those savings within their own service mix.  

Adopting the bundled payment model, the quantity of care might be either reduced. On one hand, the lump-sum payment encourages providers to reduce unnecessary care in order to save money. In traditional fee-for-service model, providers have no incentive to do so because additional care translates to additional revenue. Moreover, coordination inside bundled payment model avoids complications and readmissions. From these two perspectives, quantity of care will be reduced, but not the quality of care.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, various data and analysis of the bundled payment model support that it will benefit our hospital from various perspectives. It will bring profits to our system while ensure patient loyalty, and it will improve the quality of care and efficiency. Besides, the new model will also bring competition to the hospital market, incentivising all hospitals to cut costs and improve quality. Therefore, the model is so successful that our hospital should adopt it. I believe it will bring unforeseeable gains not only to our systems, but also to our patients.

Besides all benefits discussed above, I also found articles advocate bundled payments. In one article about Bundled Payments for Ambulatory Surgery, the author states that “Effective bundling of a medical condition has become feasible with the advent of patient-level big data and networked, localized markets of outpatient clinics. Bundled cases have been shown to improve care and reduce costs.” Many aspects of the new health model have proven its advantages over the current archaic and inefficient system. In another article Will Bundled Payments Change Health Care? Examining the Evidence Thus Far in Cardiovascular Care, the author argues that “Evidence regarding the quality of care has not demonstrated worsening care, and in fact, has shown improved performance in quality measures in some arenas.” Quality is a big concern in adopting the bundled payment model. However, this article provides support for improved quality of care, corroborating the conclusion that our hospital should adopt the model.

Therefore, from a broader sense, I think Medicare could also consider adopting the bundled payment model. Next time when patients go to hospitals, they could enjoy a lower costs and highly coordinated services, effectively solving various disadvantages associated with the fee-for-service environment. That’s why the innovated but efficient health care model should be adopted more widely in near future.
